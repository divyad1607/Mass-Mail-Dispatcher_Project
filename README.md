The Mass Mail Dispatcher project is a bulk email dispatching system designed to send emails in bulk to a large number of recipients.
The system has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the EmailJS API to send emails, making the system efficient and reliable.
The project can also sort and validate email addresses from CSV files, ensuring that only valid email addresses are used.
